# Robotics-2-NTUA
This repository consists of two projects regarding simulations on ROS and Catkin.

## 1. Obstacle avoidance with the xARM7 

The xARM7 robotic arm is moving along the x-axis, where two obstacles are placed having **L** distance between them. For the simulation the catkin workspace was utilized. The object avoidance algorithm is written in Python 3.6 

## 2. Moving robot 

A three wheeled moving cart, equipped with sonar and proximity sensors, was simulated in this Project. The aim of the project is to program the cart to move along the perimeter of a wall-limited space. The simulation was done in the Catkin workspace.
